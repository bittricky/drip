An exercise in recreating this [Drip Drop Animation](https://codepen.io/abehjat/pen/oXMENv).

## Technical Overview

Here's how some of the CSS animation techniques used to recreate the original function:

### Keyframes (`@keyframes`)

[Keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) define the stages of an animation sequence. Think of them as snapshots of what your element should look like at different points in time.

```css
@keyframes drip {
  to {
    top: 190px;
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
- `@keyframes drip` creates an animation named "drip"
- `to` (or `100%`) defines the end state
- The browser automatically interpolates between the starting position and `top: 190px`
- Apply it with `animation-name: drip`

**Key Takeways:**
- Use `from` and `to` for simple animations
- Use percentages (`0%`, `50%`, `100%`) for complex multi-stage animations
- The browser calculates all the in-between frames automatically

### Radial Gradient (`radial-gradient()`)

[Radial gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/radial-gradient) creates circular or elliptical color transitions, perfect for realistic lighting effects on 3D-looking objects.

```css
background: radial-gradient(
  circle at 30% 30%,
  #ffffff 20%,
  #87cefa 70%,
  #4fc3f7 100%
);
```

**Breaking it down:**
- `circle at 30% 30%` - Creates a circular gradient with its center at 30% from left, 30% from top
- `#ffffff 20%` - White color starts at the center and goes to 20% of the radius
- `#87cefa 70%` - Light blue from 20% to 70% of the radius
- `#4fc3f7 100%` - Darker blue from 70% to the edge (100%)

**Visual Effect:**
This creates a highlight effect that makes flat elements appear three-dimensional, like light hitting a water droplet.

### Cubic Bezier (`cubic-bezier()`)

[Cubic Bezier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function/cubic-bezier) has a lot of math behind the scenes, but the basic idea is that it controls the acceleration and deceleration of animations, making them feel more natural and physics-based.

```css
animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0.91, 0.19);
```

**Understand the parameters:**
- Four numbers represent two control points: `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`
- `(1, 0)` - First control point: starts fast
- `(0.91, 0.19)` - Second control point: slows down gradually
- This creates a "gravity-like" effect where the drop accelerates as it falls

**Common patterns to follow:**
- `ease-in`: slow start, fast end
- `ease-out`: fast start, slow end  
- `ease-in-out`: slow start and end, fast middle
- Custom curves let you simulate real physics

### Clip Path Polygon (`clip-path: polygon()`)

Cuts shapes out of elements by defining a [polygon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/polygon) with coordinate points.

```css
clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0% 90%, 100% 80%);
```

**How coordinates work:**
- `50% 0%` - Point at horizontal center, top edge (tip of teardrop)
- `0% 90%` - Point at left edge, 90% down from top
- `100% 80%` - Point at right edge, 80% down from top
- Browser connects these points to create the shape

**Coordinate system:**
- `0% 0%` = top-left corner
- `100% 0%` = top-right corner  
- `0% 100%` = bottom-left corner
- `100% 100%` = bottom-right corner

**Pro tip:** Use online polygon generators to visualize your shapes before coding!

## Editing It All Together

The water droplet effect combines all these techniques:

- **Keyframes** animate the falling motion
- **Radial gradients** create realistic 3D lighting
- **Cubic bezier** makes the fall feel natural with gravity
- **Clip path** shapes the teardrop tail

Each technique serves a specific purpose in creating the illusion and creating the ripple effect of water.
